## 📌 Problem Statement  
**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI Magic with Groq**  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Understanding code online is hard — especially for beginners.  
Our Chrome extension lets users simply hover or click to detect code snippets on websites like GitHub, Stack Overflow, CodePen, etc., ask questions, and get real-time explanations from Groq AI — all in the browser, no switching tabs or tools.

## 🧠 Team & Approach  
**Team Name:** Team Manthan  

**Team Members:**  
- Sanchita Tewary – (LinkedIn / GitHub)  
- Supratim Haldar – (LinkedIn / GitHub)  

**Our Approach:**  
- We wanted to solve a real and frustrating problem: understanding code while browsing.  
- Key challenges included: detecting code reliably on different websites and securing API key usage.  
- Big breakthrough: Keeping the extension frontend-only and using localStorage for secure key handling.
